# Self.py Hangman for SigIT #
**Name:** Hangman

**Languages:** Python

**Contributors:** DoctorGames

**Year:** 2021 


A simple Hangman game implemented in Python from the Self.py course

## Description ##
During my first year in the Cyber Specialization Systems Planning and Programming major (summer 2021), I was required to complete the Self.py course offered by the Cyber Education Center before starting my second year in the major. The course aimed to teach the fundamentalsÂ of the Python programming language, and its final task was to create a simple version of the popular game Hangman using Python.

A few years later, I was asked by another institution to redo the same course and upload the Hangman game on GitHub. Attached here is the same project that I developed during the beginning of my programming studies. Despite the passage of time since the creation of the program, the code still functions as intended.
